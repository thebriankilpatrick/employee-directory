# Employee Directory  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

The Employee Directory is a web application that allows the user to view, search, and sort employees.  

### Uses and How to Use  

The Employee Directory calls out to the Random User API to get back a list of 100 randomly generated users (employees).  

The page is rendered with React, and allows for some user input.  



As shown above, the user may click on the search bar to start typing a name.  The list dynamically filters with each keystroke.  

The user may also click the sort arrow, located beside the "Name" title in the table, to sort the employees into alphabetical order.
